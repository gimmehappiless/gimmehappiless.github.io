                    <p>We ought to be happy every day, and every hour. Despite the fact that we are totally the We are always unsatisfied: We will be happy if we immediately own those we don’t have. Things like a better job, more money, a meant to be together spouse, or a nice weekend seems to be so important to us now. But what does happy mean? Happy is a sort of feeling which could be “sensed” by every single human being. Given that feelings have a lot to do with the moment, it should have little to do with the past and the future.</p>
                        
                    <p>However, what we do is pushing the responsibility of being happy out to the past and the future. Namely, during the process of eagerly pursuing the so-called “happy” creates the “upset and unhappy” mood at the moment instead, and that is the reason that keeps us looking for happiness. The society offers us a variety of excuses to rationalize today’s suffering, and it also makes us believe that the future will be beautiful and hopeful.</p> 
                        
                    <p>But if we want to get the real happiness, we have to know that happiness is not about the past nor the futre, it’s about now, this moment.</p>

                <P>What does society teach us? It teaches us to be happy and always enjoy the moment; otherwise, we are wasting our lives.</P>

                <P>The contemporary capitalist society even wraps “Happiness” as a sweet superficial symbol of its commodities. It seems that buying certain products will change our lives from head to toe. Or we will possess happiness if we own specific goods. Despite the fact that we are currently going through some depressing events, we have to comfort  ourselves with words like “All is well.” So that we can ignore the wounds, pretend to be fine, and keep on going. In this way, the so-called happiness eventually becomes our goals which we use up all our lives chasing after. In our quest for happiness, we have been intended to look for things that make us happy. 
                        But are we enjoying the moment during the process of pursuing happiness? 
                        Is it that the more intentional we are, the harder it is to be found?

                <p>The more happiness you seek for,<br>
                        the farther you become from it.</p>
                <P>What does society teach us? It teaches us to be happy and always enjoy the moment; otherwise, The legitimate and real happiness does not come from others’ comments and compliments; actually, it comes from our hearts instead. The causes of happiness are so complicated that we couldn’t follow a certain formula. But; overall, we can divide it into three procedures that must be passed through. We have to acquaint our selves with the following tips if we want to achieve a stable “good condition.” :</P>    
                <P>1. Carpe diem: You have to completely live for the moment, not the passed past nor the uncertain future. You are what you do. Be a person of a beautiful spirit to live in a beautiful world.</P>
                        
                <P>2. To face and accept the “Truth”: No matter what is happening now is exciting or depressing, you have to acknowledge the reality and learn to take it in. We have been taught to be tough and brave. Being tough is not hard, what is hard is to treat everyone (including ourselves) with an open-minded heart and a beautiful spirit even we were hurt. You may not be satisfied with you in the mirror, and you clearly know that you are not perfect. What you have to know is that you “can” be imperfect no matter in the aspect of appearance or innermost being. This is you. Stop being so strict to yourself and start giving yourself some love,  generously.</P>
                <P>3. Learn to pull yourself out at a good timing: No matter in a condition of happy or sad, we should learn to strike a balance and pull ourselves out of that condition. Because we have to be conscious of reality. Although we cannot control our future, we can still plan it in advance. After adequate healing or enjoying, we still have to live for every moment, and every now.</P>
